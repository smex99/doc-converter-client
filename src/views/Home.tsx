			<p className='main-text'>
				This online document converter allows you to convert images not only to
				PDF, but several document formats. How does it work ?
			</p>

			<h2 className='main-title-sm'>Why Save Images As Documents?</h2>
			<p className='main-text'>
				Documents such as Microsoft Word documents and PDF have some distinct
				advantages over images. The most prominent being that they contain and
				allow you to edit text.
			</p>

			<h2 className='main-title-sm'>About Document Files</h2>
			<p className='main-text'>
				There are different kinds of document files you can turn your images
				into.
			</p>
			<p className='main-text'>
				Word processors like Microsoft Word and LibreOffice Writer create
				documents that can contain formatting, rich media and more. They can
				easily be edited and added to.
			</p>
			<p className='main-text'>
				Adobe PDF documents, however, are harder to edit, but thus look the same
				on every screen. They are also optimized for printing.
